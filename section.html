            <b class="text-danger">Bangladesh</b><br><br>Bangladesh,officially <b class="text-warning">the People's Republic of Bangladesh</b>, is a country in South Asia. It is the eighth-most
            populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population of 170 million in an area of
            148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and
            Myanmar to the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. It is separated from Bhutan and
            Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Dhaka, the capital and largest
            city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest
            port. The official language is <b class="text-warning">Bengali</b>, with Bangladeshi English also used in government.

            Bangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition of
            British India in 1947 as the eastern enclave of the Dominion of Pakistan, from which it gained independence in 1971
            after a bloody war.[17] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a
            stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms. The Muslim conquest after 1204 led to the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which
            an independent Bengal Sultanate and wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional
            affairs, trade, and diplomacy. The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British rule. The creation of
            Eastern Bengal and Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League was
            founded in Dhaka in 1906.[18] The Lahore Resolution in 1940 was supported by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister
            of Bengal. The present-day territorial boundary was established with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line.
            <br><br>
            In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan and was renamed East Pakistan, with
            Dhaka as the legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the 1958 Pakistani coup d'Ã©tat, and the 1970
            Pakistani general election spurred Bengali nationalism and pro-democracy movements. The refusal of the Pakistani
            military junta to transfer power to the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, triggered the Bangladesh Liberation
            War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini, aided by India, waged a successful armed revolution; the conflict saw the Bangladeshi
            genocide. The new state of Bangladesh became a constitutionally secular state in 1972, although Islam was declared the
            state religion in 1988.[19] In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed secular principles in the constitution.[20]
            The Constitution of Bangladesh officially declares it a socialist state.[21]
            <br><br>
            A middle power in the Indo-Pacific,[22] Bangladesh is home to the fifth-most spoken native language, the third-largest
            Muslim-majority population, and the second-largest economy in South Asia. It maintains the third-largest military in the
            region and is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations.[23] Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic
            based on the Westminster system. Bengalis make up almost 99% of the population.[24] The country consists of eight
            divisions, 64 districts, and 495 subdistricts, and includes the world's largest mangrove forest. Bangladesh hosts one of
            the largest refugee populations due to the Rohingya genocide.[25] Bangladesh faces challenges like corruption, political
            instability, overpopulation, and effects of climate change. Bangladesh has twice chaired the Climate Vulnerable Forum
            and hosts the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) headquarters. It
            is a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and a member of the Organization of
            Islamic Cooperation and the Commonwealth of Nations.<br><br>
